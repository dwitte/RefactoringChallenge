Our business has been flourishing, we need to include a second day to receive shipments instead of just Saturdays.

The business owner has scheduled deliveries to occur on Saturdays and Wednesdays. As a results, we need to modify our
program to accommodate this new requirement.

You need to write some tests for the new situations, as well as incorporate the new requirement into your refactored code.

Everything else must remain the same for the program, and the discount days and amounts have not changed.
